            <p class='bio-text'>
                I'm a web developer working on completing a Full Stack Web Development 
                bootcamp at Thinkful. I started coding at a young age but took a break to pursue my other 
                passions in my early 20's. I'm excited to come back to more technical pursuits as I work 
                to develop new skills as a coder and web developer. I'm especially interested in developing 
                products at the intersection of technology and the outdoors.
            </p>
            <p class='bio-text'>
                In my spare time, you can find me rock climbing throughout the U.S. and abroad. 
                I'm an avid mountaineer, mountain biker, caver, and kayaker as well. I have spent 
                years in the outdoor education feild working to get more kids spending time outside. 
                In addition to outdoor pursuits, I am a musician and create ambient music using a 
                modular synthesizer.
